# Lorenz System Forecasting

This example expands on the readme Lorenz system forecasting to better showcase how to use methods and functions provided in the library for Echo State Networks. Here the prediction method used is `Generative`, for a more detailed explanation of the differences between `Generative` and `Predictive` please refer to the other examples given in the documentation.

## Generating the data

Starting off the workflow, the first step is to obtain the data. Leveraging `OrdinaryDiffEq` it is possible to derive the Lorenz system data in the following way:

```@example lorenz
using OrdinaryDiffEq

#define lorenz system
function lorenz!(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = 10.0 * (u[2] - u[1])
    du[2] = u[1] * (28.0 - u[3]) - u[2]
    du[3] = u[1] * u[2] - (8 / 3) * u[3]
end

#solve and take data
prob = ODEProblem(lorenz!, [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], (0.0, 200.0))
data = solve(prob, ABM54(), dt = 0.02)
```

After obtaining the data, it is necessary to determine the kind of prediction for the model. Since this example will use the `Generative` prediction type, this means that the target data will be the next step of the input data. In addition, it is important to notice that the Lorenz system just obtained presents a transient period that is not representative of the general behavior of the system. This can easily be discarded by setting a `shift` parameter.

```@example lorenz
#determine shift length, training length and prediction length
shift = 300
train_len = 5000
predict_len = 1250

#split the data accordingly
input_data = data[:, shift:(shift + train_len - 1)]
target_data = data[:, (shift + 1):(shift + train_len)]
test_data = data[:, (shift + train_len + 1):(shift + train_len + predict_len)]
```

It is *important* to notice that the data needs to be formatted in a matrix with the features as rows and time steps as columns as in this example. This is needed even if the time series consists of single values.

## Building the Echo State Network

Once the data is ready, it is possible to define the parameters for the ESN and the `ESN` struct itself. In this example, the values from [^1] are loosely followed as general guidelines.

```@example lorenz
using ReservoirComputing

#define ESN parameters
res_size = 300
in_size = 3
res_radius = 1.2
res_sparsity = 6 / 300
input_scaling = 0.1

#build ESN struct
esn = ESN(input_data, in_size, res_size;
    reservoir = rand_sparse(; radius = res_radius, sparsity = res_sparsity),
    input_layer = weighted_init(; scaling = input_scaling),
    reservoir_driver = RNN(),
    nla_type = NLADefault(),
    states_type = StandardStates())
```

Most of the parameters chosen here mirror the default ones, so a direct call is not necessary. The readme example is identical to this one, except for the explicit call. Going line by line to see what is happening, starting from `res_size`: this value determines the dimensions of the reservoir matrix. In this case, a size of 300 has been chosen, so the reservoir matrix will be 300 x 300. This is not always the case, since some input layer constructions can modify the dimensions of the reservoir, but in that case, everything is taken care of internally.

The `res_radius` determines the scaling of the spectral radius of the reservoir matrix; a proper scaling is necessary to assure the Echo State Property. The default value in the `rand_sparse` method is 1.0 in accordance with the most commonly followed guidelines found in the literature (see [^2] and references therein). The `sparsity` of the reservoir matrix in this case is obtained by choosing a degree of connections and dividing that by the reservoir size. Of course, it is also possible to simply choose any value between 0.0 and 1.0 to test behaviors for different sparsity values.

The value of `input_scaling` determines the upper and lower bounds of the uniform distribution of the weights in the `weighted_init`. The value of 0.1 represents the default. The default input layer is the `scaled_rand`, a dense matrix. The details of the weighted version can be found in [^3], for this example, this version returns the best results.

The reservoir driver represents the dynamics of the reservoir. In the standard ESN definition, these dynamics are obtained through a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and this is reflected by calling the `RNN` driver for the `ESN` struct. This option is set as the default, and unless there is the need to change parameters, it is not needed. The full equation is the following:

```math
\textbf{x}(t+1) = (1-\alpha)\textbf{x}(t) + \alpha \cdot \text{tanh}(\textbf{W}\textbf{x}(t)+\textbf{W}_{\text{in}}\textbf{u}(t))
```

where ``α`` represents the leaky coefficient, and tanh can be any activation function. Also, ``\textbf{x}`` represents the state vector, ``\textbf{u}`` the input data, and ``\textbf{W}, \textbf{W}_{\text{in}}`` are the reservoir matrix and input matrix, respectively. The default call to the RNN in the library is the following `RNN(;activation_function=tanh, leaky_coefficient=1.0)`, where the meaning of the parameters is clear from the equation above. Instead of the hyperbolic tangent, any activation function can be used, either leveraging external libraries such as `NNlib` or creating a custom one.

The final calls are modifications to the states in training or prediction. The default calls, depicted in the example, do not make any modifications to the states. This is the safest bet if one is not sure how these work. The `nla_type` applies a non-linear algorithm to the states, while the `states_type` can expand them by concatenating them with the input data, or padding them by concatenating a constant value to all the states. More in depth descriptions of these parameters are given in other examples in the documentation.

## Training and Prediction

Now that the ESN has been created and all the parameters have been explained, it is time to proceed with the training. The full call of the readme example follows this general idea:

```@example lorenz
#define training method
training_method = StandardRidge(0.0)

#obtain output layer
output_layer = train(esn, target_data, training_method)
```

The training returns an `OutputLayer` struct containing the trained output matrix and other  needed for the prediction. The necessary elements in the `train()` call are the `ESN` struct created in the previous step and the `target_data`, which in this case is the one step ahead evolution of the Lorenz system. The training method chosen in this example is the standard one, so an equivalent way of calling the `train` function here is `output_layer = train(esn, target_data)` like the readme basic version. Likewise, the default value for the ridge regression parameter is set to zero, so the actual default training is Ordinary Least Squares regression. Other training methods are available and will be explained in the following examples.

Once the `OutputLayer` has been obtained, the prediction can be done following this procedure:

```@example lorenz
output = esn(Generative(predict_len), output_layer)
```

both the training method and the output layer are needed in this call. The number of steps for the prediction must be specified in the `Generative` method. The output results are given in a matrix.

!!! info "Saving the states during prediction"
    
    While the states are saved in the `ESN` struct for the training, for the prediction they are not saved by default. To inspect the states, it is necessary to pass the boolean keyword argument `save_states` to the prediction call, in this example using `esn(... ; save_states=true)`. This returns a tuple `(output, states)` where `size(states) = res_size, prediction_len`

To inspect the results, they can easily be plotted using an external library. In this case, `Plots` is adopted:

```@example lorenz
using Plots, Plots.PlotMeasures

ts = 0.0:0.02:200.0
lorenz_maxlyap = 0.9056
predict_ts = ts[(shift + train_len + 1):(shift + train_len + predict_len)]
lyap_time = (predict_ts .- predict_ts[1]) * (1 / lorenz_maxlyap)

p1 = plot(lyap_time, [test_data[1, :] output[1, :]], label = ["actual" "predicted"],
    ylabel = "x(t)", linewidth = 2.5, xticks = false, yticks = -15:15:15);
p2 = plot(lyap_time, [test_data[2, :] output[2, :]], label = ["actual" "predicted"],
    ylabel = "y(t)", linewidth = 2.5, xticks = false, yticks = -20:20:20);
p3 = plot(lyap_time, [test_data[3, :] output[3, :]], label = ["actual" "predicted"],
    ylabel = "z(t)", linewidth = 2.5, xlabel = "max(λ)*t", yticks = 10:15:40);

plot(p1, p2, p3, plot_title = "Lorenz System Coordinates",
    layout = (3, 1), xtickfontsize = 12, ytickfontsize = 12, xguidefontsize = 15,
    yguidefontsize = 15,
    legendfontsize = 12, titlefontsize = 20)
```
