# Echo State Networks

The core component of an ESN is the `ESN` type. It represents the entire Echo State Network and includes parameters for configuring the reservoir, input scaling, and output weights. Here's the documentation for the `ESN` type:

```@docs

```

## Training

To train an ESN model, you can use the `train` function. It takes the ESN model, training data, and other optional parameters as input and returns a trained model. Here's the documentation for the train function:

```@docs
    train
```

With these components and variations, you can configure and train ESN models for various time series and sequential data prediction tasks.
